This is a collection of solutions to selected exercises from Learning Scientific Programming with Python by Christian Hill in February 2016.
> If you need clarification about the code or want to report a bug, please open an issue instead of emailing me directly. And unfortunately, I do not have exercise answers for the book.
As you can see from the description of this repository, this file aims to code and solve the problems behind each cheater from the book "Learning_Scientific_Programming_with_Python."
Also, for examples inside some charters, I deprecated the original code and edited some that you may need to notice. But I am sure that it is still functioning well.
Due to a lack of time to finish all the problems, I could pick some short questions as exercises, and most of them are shown here already.
Welcome to share your idea, perspective, and coding here!!
